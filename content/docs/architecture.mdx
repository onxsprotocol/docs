## Multi-Layer Blockchain Stack

Oorth Nexus combines a Layer 1 blockchain with Layer 2 rollup technology to deliver enterprise-grade performance and transparency.

### Edge to Blockchain

- Edge computing: real-time processing at the source for IoT devices and sensors.
- Fog computing: aggregation and local processing between edge and core.
- Blockchain: immutable ledger for trust, transparency, and consensus.

## Sovereign Data Object (SDO)

Every piece of data in Oorth Nexus is represented as a Sovereign Data Object. Data does not change ownership even when shared.

### Key Characteristics

- End-to-end encryption: all data is encrypted from source to destination.
- DID ownership: ownership is determined through decentralized identity.
- Smart contract access: access is controlled through programmable contracts.

### Data Owner Controls

- Define exactly who can view or use your data.
- Control the purpose of access, from audits to valuation use cases.
- Set time-limited access windows for data sharing.

## Network and Governance

- Global network: worldwide node distribution for high availability.
- Community governance: decentralized decision-making through transparent voting.
- Immutable transaction ledger with native ONXS staking.
