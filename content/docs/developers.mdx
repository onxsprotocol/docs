## Developer Overview

Oorth Nexus provides tooling and infrastructure for building enterprise-grade applications in ethical and halal industries. The protocol supports private-by-design data sharing, smart contracts, and scalable Layer 2 execution.

## Implementation Blueprint

1. Define the use case and compliance scope.
2. Select the right plan based on expected throughput and support needs.
3. Use SDKs and APIs to integrate protocol features into your application.
4. Build and deploy smart contracts with the virtual machine.
5. Use the smart wallet system for on-chain actions.
6. Monitor activity and verify transactions in the block explorer.
7. Scale via Layer 2 rollups and near-zero fee execution.

## Developer Tools

- Leo Language: build private applications.
- SDKs and APIs: integration layer for enterprise systems.
- CLI Tools: low-level commands and utilities.
- Node Software: operate and connect to the network.
- Virtual Machine: run computation for smart contracts.

## Privacy and Compliance

- Private by design with smart contract programmability.
- Share only what is necessary for audits or regulation.
- Program data access controls and time-limited sharing windows.

## Support and Access

- Testnet access is available for early development.
- Mainnet access and priority support are available on growth plans.
- Enterprise deployments include dedicated infrastructure and custom SLAs.
